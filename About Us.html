		<h3>About the Island</h3>
		<p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500
		square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe 
		harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano.
	    Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the 
		Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
