  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
		<h3>Attractions</h3>
		<p>A Nine hole golf course will be operational by next year's time, so don't forget to keep an eye out for that! 
		Taniti City boasts all manner of native architecture to be admired and explored. Tours are held daily for those who
		want to deep dive into the history of the city. Both boat and bus tours are great options for tourists who wish to
		partake in this. The city also has movie theatres, art galleries, and bowling alleys. Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area 
		on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.

		<h3>Eating and Drinking</h3>
		<p>In Taniti City, there are plenty of places to get a great meal and try new drinks. There are multiple pubs
		on the main strip, that all have excellent ratings. The Crushed Coconut is a tourist favorite. A microbrewery
		is also available for those new to the experience. Many new restauraunts have also seen good business in the past
		few years along with some age old classics. Many local and classic chefs can provide Taniti cuisine that won't be found
		anywhere else in the world, along with a few franchises for those apprehensive to try new things at first. Everyone is
		welcome to come try and see for themeselves!</p>
	</div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
		<h3>Family Activities</h3>
		<p>Sandy white beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay are one of the main draws of resort. Sand unlike almost any other
		on earth. The beaches are also kept clean for tourists and locals alike. Plenty of fun can be had for the whole family
		as pamphlets are available detailing hikes to the rainforest, visits to Taniti's active volcano, a trip to the museum,
		and oceanside tours via helicopter.
